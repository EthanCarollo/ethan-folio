# Another video game?

Yes, exactly, another one. I quite like video games and when I started school, I had high hopes I'd be making some (and I did :3), but they're often Rushed projects with tight deadlines and other things to do at the same time—basically, not always enough time to do things right and have fun.

# So, the start

But for Pokésket, it was different. For the Unity course with Colin Peyrat during my 3rd bachelor year, I decided I'd take it seriously and really tryhard by teaming up with my friend **Emmanuel Moulin** ([GitHub](https://github.com/Kibishi47)).
So, we needed an idea. Something simple, a bit silly, and I happened to be playing NBA at the time. I thought to myself: we're not designers, we're not artists, we're bad at 3D, but we're good at coding. Let's make a sport game, but in 2D, with sprites, and simple but effective gameplay. So we made Pokésket, a basketball game with Pokémon. (Which is perfect since Pokémon sprites already exist, making things easier for us.)

A small 1v1 game themed around Pokémon and basketball, so we could have some fun between classes from time to time.

# Development

We wanted gameplay somewhat like NBA 2K, but in 2.5D, with Pokémon.
(When I say 2.5D, I mean 2D sprites but with a 3D camera, which allows for camera movements, smoother animations, and a certain sense of depth.)

We worked heavily with Unity's Scriptable Objects so we could add and remove Pokémon as we pleased. This was the coolest part in the end, as adding Pokémon became a game in itself for us.

# Is that it?

And yes, that's it. That's why this is just a short note, to remember that this project existed. It's available right here: https://github.com/methil-mods/pokesket/tree/main

I don't have many visuals from the game during development, but I've put a few below so you can see what it looked like.
