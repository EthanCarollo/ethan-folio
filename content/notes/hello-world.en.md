# Welcome to my Notes

This is the first note of my new personal blog system integrated into my portfolio. The idea is to have a less formal space than the *Projects* section to write about:

- Technical discoveries
- Design reflections
- Code snippets that might be useful
- Updates on what I'm learning

## About this section

This note system operates a bit like a classic blog, except I don't take it too seriously. It's a space for spontaneous articles, without pressure, where I share what I am currently working on.

See you soon!
