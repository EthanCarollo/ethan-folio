# Introduction to Web Development

Web development is the art and science of creating websites and web applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the fundamental technologies and concepts that power the modern web.

## What is Web Development?

Web development encompasses everything from simple static websites to complex web applications. It involves:

- **Frontend Development**: The client-side, what users see and interact with
- **Backend Development**: The server-side, handling data and business logic
- **Full-Stack Development**: Both frontend and backend

## Core Technologies

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML provides the structure of web pages. It's the foundation upon which everything else is built.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS controls the presentation, layout, and styling of web pages.

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### JavaScript
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  console.log('Page loaded!');
});
```
