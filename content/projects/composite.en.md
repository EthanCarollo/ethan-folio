# Introduction

Composite is a project created during a Workshop with the [FullStory](https://fullstory.fr/) collective to celebrate the 10th anniversary of [Les Papeteries](https://www.lespapeteries.com/). 
To achieve this, I collaborated with Théo ([Nak0x](https://github.com/nak0x)), Paul Figari, and Elsa Freppaz.

This workshop took place intensively over **a single week**. Therefore, we had to discover a completely new software from scratch (TouchDesigner) and figure out how to collaborate on it efficiently to produce the best possible result by the end of the week.

# The Original Idea

The initial idea actually came from Paul Figari: he wanted to create an interactive "exquisite corpse" (cadavre exquis) displayed over several small squares. While brainstorming, the group stumbled upon an Instagram video of someone filming a protest using a Kinect camera with a very cool visual style. 

Digging deeper into how it was made, we discovered **TouchDesigner**, which turned out to be incredibly powerful for generating interactive visuals. Inspired by the possibilities, we went out and bought Kinect cameras to get started.

# Discovering the Tools and Building the Structure

Tackling TouchDesigner in just a few days was a real challenge. It's a node-based visual programming environment with a steep learning curve. While we were learning how to algorithmically process the signal from the Kinect, another crucial step emerged: building the projection surface itself.

We ended up buying cardboard, cutting it, and assembling it to build the physical structure that our final visuals would be mapped onto (using MadMapper). Making sure the structure could stand solidly on its own for the exhibition was a challenge in itself!

# Collaboration Strategy

Given the very short timeframe (only 5 days of production), organization was key. We had to cleverly divide tasks between learning the nodes, visual composition, and the final projection via MadMapper. 

To find an efficient workflow, we decided to separate each small visual effect into its own `.tox` module file. This allowed us to work in parallel before finally combining them all together onto the main Kinect input signal at the end.

This also introduced an additional, fun challenge: to share these `.tox` files, everyone on the team (designers and developers alike) had to use **Git** on the [project repository](https://github.com/EthanCarollo/composite)!

# The Final Result

The outcome of this intensive week was projected live for the 10th anniversary of Les Papeteries, blending the visuals generated by our group with the physical structure of the projection room.

# Recap Video

To learn a bit more about the behind-the-scenes of the project, Elsa created a wonderful video documenting our adventure during this workshop week. Feel free to check it out: [Watch Elsa's video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P60B5-lntTk)!
